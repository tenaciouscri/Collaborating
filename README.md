**  I love pizza! (I know, shocking)

If you want to bake a pizza, you'll need flour, beer yeast, 
tomato sauce and mozzarella. IMPORTANT: no pineapple will ever be involved in
a pizza recipe.

Firstly, make the dough by mixing the flour with water, salt, olive oil 
and beer yeast and let it rise. Secondly, spread out the dough in a 
round shape. Then, add the tomato sauce and as much mozzarella as you 
like. Bake it and enjoy!

happy or beneficial way. "a fortunate stroke of serendipity"

**Hot Chocolate recipe**
Place the milk of your choice in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Using milk instead of water, makes this hot chocolate extra creamy and flavorful. I prefer whole milk or 2% milk, but you can choose any milk that you choose (Iâ€™ve even used unsweetened almond milk).
Whisk in cocoa powder and sugar, and heat until warm.
Once the milk is warm, add chocolate chips, whisking until they melt into the milk.
Add a splash of vanilla extract.
Serve immediately, topped with your favorite garnishes: marshmallows, whipped cream, chopped chocolate, crushed candy canes or more.

**word definition**
