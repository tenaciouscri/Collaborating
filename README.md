**  I love pizza! (I know, shocking)

If you want to bake a pizza, you'll need flour, beer yeast, 
tomato sauce and mozzarella. IMPORTANT: no pineapple will ever be involved in
a pizza recipe.

Firstly, make the dough by mixing the flour with water, salt, olive oil 
and beer yeast and let it rise. Secondly, spread out the dough in a 
round shape. Then, add the tomato sauce and as much mozzarella as you 
like. Bake it and enjoy!
